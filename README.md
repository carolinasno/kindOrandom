### kindOrandom

kindOrandom is the app that encourages you to be kind.

### Development Approach

The first step to developing kindOrandom was to build a form to enter in the random act of kindness and a display section to show the random act of kindness. Once that was complete, the Google Maps API was added to include a visual element of where the random act of kindness took place.
